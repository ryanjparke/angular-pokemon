            each item in an array. Similar to how in react we could map over an
            array inside of a reducer.

            ng-repeat="card in cards"
          In angular we specify the variable name we want to use for each individual
          itteration, in this case it will be a single `card` we then specify which
          array or objevt we want to be looping over.  In this case our array of
          `cards`

        ng-repeat also lets us attach a filter to our repeat.  The | (pipe) is
        letting us apply a function prior to handing it to the ng-repeat.
         ng-repeat = "... | filter:basicFilter"
        filter is the name of the built in filter we want to use
          (there are other built in functions, and you can create your own)
        basicFilter is the variable that we will be using to store the filter
        we want to use.  If basicFilter is a string. Angular will go through
        each card in our cards array, and see if it (or a property on it) contains
        the basicFilter. So if we filter it for 'wa' it will find any pokemon
        that has 'wa' in any of it's values.  So if you have a pokemon named
        'Walter' or a pokemon of type 'Water' if would pass the filter.

        Instead of giving a string, we instead give it an object, it will check
        that they have properties that match.  If basicFilter was
        {name:'chu'} it would find all pokemon whose name contains chu, so Pikachu
        , Raichu, Chubaka, and Chuuuuuuuuuuuu would all pass that filter.
